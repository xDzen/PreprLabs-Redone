They oversee all of the other departments on the web team and because of this will have some general knowledge on how to work the majority of them. There might be a variation of what this position is called but the purpose remains the same: ensure quality content and functionality of the web content and lead a successful web team.  
                                The web manager is responsible for the delegation of duties among the team and because of this carries a great deal of responsibility depending on how the team performs. One of the goals of most web managers is to ensure that on a daily basis, all of the web components are all functioning at the most basic acceptable levels. Like managers in other industries, they are driven by getting positive results regarding feedback, increased monetary profits and cost reduction and also, high employee performance.

                            <div class="float-child-lab-description">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the current economy, Americans shift jobs every 4-5 years, which translates into 8-10 job transitions, including several career changes, over one’s life time. With competition for jobs on the rise, a person’s continuing employability and career success are increasingly defined by his or her mastery of individual career development and the ability to effectively "manage oneself" (P. Drucker). In this course, you will learn how to think strategically and professionally about your career self-management.
                                Through this course you'll develop an objective, external view of your marketable skills as a solid foundation for building a strong career brand. In particular, you'll be able to: - explain why developing a protean and boundaryless career perspective based on transferable (portable) skills is advantageous for continuing employability and career growth.
                                your area of interest and examine practices of evidence-based, data-driven competitive employee selection; -implement your newly developed skills for crafting effective selection criteria statements and refining your job applications.

Just as a reminder, by January 19th we’re looking to have your team’s Project submission, your completed Digital Capabilities Lab of choice, and all seven Challenges associated with the Career Planning Lab. For your team’s Project, remember that only one team member per team needs to submit the project, but by inviting their other team members to that Project it will show up on everyone’s PreprLabs user profile and everyone will get credit! Most of you have already done this... </div>

                                The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</div>
